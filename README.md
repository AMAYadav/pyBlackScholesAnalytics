[**pyBlackScholesAnalytics**](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics) is a Python package that uses the widespread Black-Scholes model 
to evaluate the price, P&L and greeks of European options (both plain-vanilla and simple equity exotics 
such as cash-or-nothing Digital options), as well as simple option strategies built on them.

The package has been developed as a side project of the ["IT for Business and Finance"](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/IT-For-Business-And-Finance-2019-20) class 
I held at the University of Siena this year for the Master degree in Finance.

Regarding the style and the idea of this project, [**pyBlackScholesAnalytics**](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics) 
puts itself in the middle between the coding style and level of a master student and that required 
for a junior quant at an investment bank. It aims to address the gap between the two providing a playground 
for students to master financial concepts related to options and option strategies and implementing a dedicated comprehensive
object-oriented architecture.

[**pyBlackScholesAnalytics**](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics) comes with several examples to explore the features of the package, a series of 4 Jupyter notebooks 
and video-lectures in which I tried to introduce the package in a constructive way as a step-by-step formalization of plausible
business requirements into object-oriented styles.
