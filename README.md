# pyBlackScholesAnalytics

[**pyBlackScholesAnalytics**](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics) is a Python package for implementing analytics for options and option strategies under the Black-Scholes Model for educational purposes.

# Summary

[**pyBlackScholesAnalytics**](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics) package is a Python package designed to use the well known Black-Scholes model 
to evaluate price, P&L and greeks of European options (both plain-vanilla and simple equity exotics 
such as cash-or-nothing Digital options), as well as simple option strategies built on them.

The package has been developed as a side project of the ["IT for Business and Finance"](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/IT-For-Business-And-Finance-2019-20) class 
I held at the University of Siena for the Master degree in Finance in 2020.

[**pyBlackScholesAnalytics**](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics) places itself in the middle between the coding style and level of a master student and that required for a junior quant at an investment bank. The aim is to address the gap between the two providing a playground 
for students to master financial concepts related to options and option strategies and implementing a dedicated comprehensive
object-oriented architecture.

# Resources 

[**pyBlackScholesAnalytics**](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics) comes with several [examples](https://github.com/gabrielepompa88/pyBlackScholesAnalytics/tree/master/pyblackscholesanalytics) (`example_*.py` files) to explore the features of the package. A series of 4 Jupyter notebooks introduces step-by step the ideas of the Object-Oriented paradygm as improvements over sequential implementations:

Finally, YouTube video-lectures are provided for each notebook:

in which I tried to introduce the package in a constructive way as a step-by-step formalization of plausible
business requirements into object-oriented styles.
